9/17/2017 2:47PM: Initial reading of project directions and copy of files. Also
beginning of header creation with the listed funcs from the assignment.

9/18/2017 6:20PM: working on copying the functions from the id.h into id.cpp and
doing what i can to populate the obvious parts of the functions.

9/19/2017 10:20AM: Having a hard time with the copy assignment function, lots of
errors, finally added ID:: seemed to help, got a different error now to work on

9/20/2017 9:10AM: No other classes so working on this all day, got pretty much
everything filled in except the ostream overloard operator portion, which is
definitely something I am going to have to review/research. I remember how to do
most of the function this-> I learned a little about in a prior java class.

9/21/2017 11:15AM: Still stumped on the overload part so I am going to make the
makefile out and see how I can compile and go back to it. Makefile is done, now
it just goes to error for operator ostream when i compile so that is last thing
to figure out, before being able to observe behavior.  
 
9/21/2017 12:24PM: I can compile without errors but when i run nothing prints, not
sure where my problem is just yet, possibly with the print formatting.  

9/21/2017 1:08PM Looks like i have two problems with my code, the first problem
is in idtest1 i get all ofthe same values but there is a problem with the names
on the transitive assignment check, i moved stuff around and now i get no names
at all, think i have a problem with dynamic memory allocation.Getting a huge
error on the bottom of the screen after i print out.

9/21/2017 5:40PM Just got home from physics and wanted to try something that
occurred to me about the chars and null terminating them, i set them equal to
len +1 and then null terminated them and it no longer erros an prints,below is
my printout for idtest1 currently, going to test idtest2 next.

This looks good I believe I'm getting somewhere.

Going to try a robocheck to see. 

9/22/2017 9:54AM: Robo check didn't show any differences and i am feeling okay
because I have learned some of this in my prior class. However the coding
standards in this class are much more strict so i am going to take the extra
time i have today before the weekend (my birthday) to go over the coding
standards and refine my code before doing a final submit.
