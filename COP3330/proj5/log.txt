10/23/2017 5:36PM: Getting a late start on this one because I had a physics exam
today so I was cramming all weekend, just copied the files and brought over the
files from last project, going to read the assignment doc tonight and test out
tracker_i.x to see what kind of behavior the project is demanding.

10/24/2017 9:23AM: Today I am reading the doc again and I am starting tracker.cpp
and declaring the constants, then thinking about how I will do my main loop. The
printing seems straighforward enough but the cases are gonna take some thinking
I am still trying to digest the information in the doc. Seems like a significant
amount of branching and probably a big while or do while loop. It also seems
that we are not told the exact length of the different strings so there will have
to a counter for those for the end. I worked at AVIS car rental and different
people had different length driver license numbers, older or longer time residents 
were shorter because they've had theirs longer. Also some license plates were
shorter because they had a symbol before or after the characters so that's
pretty realistic and neat.

10/26/2017 9:13AM: working on tracker.cpp trying to pattern it off the
style of the vtester with the big loop and cases. Basically right now I am
starting my loop so I am typing in all kinds of terrible values to try and make
tracker_i.x break so I can see what types of error messages I need and
behavior. if 0 nothing happens, but it has other messages for wrong data types
that I have found.
Example:

** Tracker error: unable to read shift size

10/26/2017 2:28PM: been working on this all day, have most everything filled in
except for the print formatting, i just finished up the make file so I could
actually make an executable instead of just co3330 and my printing is
hilariously poor.

 Shift 1 Log
 ===============  
okay it actually looks way worse than that on the screen and runs all over the
place so I am going to have to look at how I did the lengths of the strings
formatting. 

So they all just needed \n after them so thats looking better. 
Now I have to actually get some values in the log portion.
And my freight is showing an integer so I am going to format that. 

10/26/2017 5:39PM: Home from class working on my printing, shift1 prints fine
but my output gets all screwed up during shift2 when there are more values.
Type  Pass Cap  Load Cap  Registration  Operator ID  Operator CDL  
  ----  --------  --------  ------------  -----------  ------------  
   UNK
         0
      0.00
  1vehicle      
Driver_1_ID  
Driver_1_CDL  
   CAR
        25
Okay nevermind got that fixed up it was actually pretty minor it just needed a
\n at the end n the loop. It is now printing the same as the area51 executables.
