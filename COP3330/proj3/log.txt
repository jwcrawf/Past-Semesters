9/22/2017 3:41PM: Initialization of project log, copying and inspection of included files. 
Creation of deliverable files & their headers to outline project. Just getting
familiar with the project but about to focus on exam.

10/2/2017 9:17PM: Exam week is over so I am back on this project. Have made a
header prime.h and have copied those definitions into prime.cpp to begin
constructing the listed functions with.  

10/9/2017 9:51AM: Took a brief hiatus for math exam but today I am working on my
bitvect implementation. 
10/9/2017 6:11PM: I am able to compile with the co3330 command without errors
and create and executable fbitvect.x, no errors are shown and I can mess with
the menu a little, think I am on to the next step of the project.

Thank you for testing BitVector

Obviously nothing else much to see yet but we move on...

10/10/2017 8:56AM: working on prime.cpp mainly on the sieve function as its the
main component that we need to figure out. have populated some of the other
functions in prime (the easy ones) will spend most of today on the others. 

10/10/2017 12:38PM: co3330 prime is not showing any errors but I still dont know
if what i did works, just that it is syntactically correct. Gonna work on the
makefile to see how this project will build out.

10/10/2917 2:08PM: makefile is finally done and I have been playing with fprime
to see how my prime.cpp works, have a couple errors so far just in teh things i
have tried, first my numbers were printing vertically so i had to fix my os <<
and now I am looking and my numbers are wrong I have too many primes. I need to
fix my Sieve because it is not unsetting in the proper increment apparently.

Enter selection ('M' for menu, 'Q' to quit): A
  p.All(32): 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 11 13 14 16 17 19 20 22 23 26 28 29 31 
 
I can reset upperbound, copy assign, etc but I know I have to rework sieve.

10/10/2017 3:16PM: It works!
Enter selection ('M' for menu, 'Q' to quit): A
  p.All(32): 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 
I noticed my upper bound says one more than the area51 exe so I am going to look at that
next.
Got it i think, it was because of n+1.
Had to tweak expand a bit too. noticed an error message I needed to include on
it and Largest when the argument is too large.
 
10/10/2017 6:01PM: Did my first robocheck and I have two errors to work on. One
with the printout from p.All there needs to be a leading space before all the
numbers are printed, should be easy enough.

Example:
Results fprime.x 150 p.com2 (diff only)
-----------------------------------------
17c17
<   p.All(150):  2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79
83 89 97 101 103 107 109 113 127 131 137 139 149

89 97 101 103 107 109 113 127 131 137 139 149 

** The second error is with my
makefile It appears I am not supposed to include bitvect.h in prime.cpp anymore.
Error:

Result of build w student makefile 
----------------------------------
make: *** No rule to make target `bitvect.h', needed by `prime.o'.  Stop.
 
10/10/2017 9:34PM: Keep trying with this makefile and getting errors on my
robocheck for target

Example:
make: *** No rule to make target `bitvect.h', needed by `bitvect.o'.  Stop.

I finally see that there is # in front of bitvect.h in Lacher example.   

bitvect.o: bitvect.cpp # bitvect.h
        $(CC) -c bitvect.cpp

And mine did not have the pound because logically I was thinking I needed it like
the prior makefiles.

10/13/2017 9:27AM: Yesterday I went back through the project and cleaned out
unneccessary comments, I see now that the whole commenting above everything is
kinda amateurish anyway so I plan on just using it for myself when I'm trying to
figure something out or only as needed. I used up 4/5 submissions trying to
figure out why mymakefile had that dumb # symbol so I have only one submission
left I have been debating on using it but I am kinda scared to use it because
its the last one!
