Log for project 4

2/27/2018 2:13PM: Had my last midterm yesterday so i am just getting a look at
this material today but I have already done some reading the past week. Have
copied over all the files and plan for my preliminary recon of the project this
afternoon. Realize this is a marginally late start but I have the entire week to
code and midterms were unavoidable.

2/28/2018 7:39PM: Stopping for the day, Refactored wordsmith2.h and
wordsmith2.cpp today and set up the skeletons for the functions I will be doing
in OAA. Tomorrow and friday will be 9-5 OAA days for me so I think I am still in
okay shape especially if I do some more reading on the lectures tonight. I have
already read them multiple times but I've noticed more things of note each
time. Especially after my MAD3105 homework for trees, it is pretty neat how the 
two classes are lined up on perfectly the same material this week.

3/2/2018 11:46AM: So I have been working on this project since about 8am and I
have something in everything that needs to be coded I'm just chasing down errors
to compile with c4530. Had to make minor alterations in the slides and I found
in the book on page 167 how to do the recursive Order methods for traversal.

3/2/2018 2:03PM: I was able to compile and run my own versions of foaa and test
out my trees and I have to say the stuff with the colors is so cool! sometimes
you just gotta give the man his due and that was just really neat. I am able to
get similar output on almost all the tests so I am going to continue testing and
see what else I can find but for now I am going to test my wordsmith again and
see how that goes.
--
Okay there were some things I needed to fix that almost got by me in wordsmith
namely the new difference in the vocabulary size output variable so I had to do
somthing with that and for the longest time I was forgetting to put the include
statements I had used for the original wordsmith but all is okay now and I just
tested wordsmith with some files and did an sdiff and it all works as intended.  
 
3/2/2018 4:37PM: Finished the makefile and have every file completed now I am
just chasing a bug with moaa. my foaa, foaa+, and wordsmith all work correctly
but I am unable to even start an moaa test it errors right after the first
message is displayed. 
I can see from looking at the code that it checks for size
and height but my size and height both worked correctly on foaa so I am going to
keep looking around for what's going on. The test isn't exactly erroring just
nothing is happening.

3/2/2018 5:01PM: I am getting a makefile error with with foaa but my code is as
described in the discussion board post and it works on linprog so I am thinking
about what that could mean.

crawford@linprog4.cs.fsu.edu:~/cop4530/proj4>

Also, still having trouble with moaa not making a test so I am looking into
that.
 
3/2/2018 7:08PM: After an exhaustive search I found the error and I am able to
test moaa and it works as it should, in the end it was a simple thing in my
preorder i had copied down the text from inorder and not changed the call to
match the function it was in. But when you stress yourself out over something it
becomes harder to see what is right in front of you.

Testing OAA < String , int > at trial 5 x 10000:
  x2.Size()              ==  3849
  x2.Height()            ==  26
  optimal ht (size)      ==  11

Test Complete

3/3/2018 8:53AM: I am still getting this makefile error on the robograder but I
pass everything else so I am going to remove all the library from my project
folder amd try to set my makefile up to compile as if there is nothing copied
over from the lib and maybe that will simulate how the robograder compilation is
performed, my fall back is to go old school and just compile everything
seperately the long way and then combine it. 

9:21AM: revisited some cop3330 material to make sure I am not taking liberties
with this makefile understanding and I actually found an interesting
anomaly. Since our makefile is not named makefile it is not holding a tab as
well it is converting it to spaces. I know that this is the case because when i
hit tab and it is named makefile the cursor moves with a pink color behind it
and it does not when it is named something other than makefile. the name
makefile holds properties in emacs and handles this. I was able to rename my
makefile as makefile, indent the tab correctly and then rename it back to
makefile.ws2 to solve this issue.

9:29AM: It still errored on the robograde so I guess I am going to go the long
way and compile all the code. I tried the way from the discussion board but it
failed right at foaa on the robograder. It said no rule to make target foaa.cpp
so naturally now I will compile foaa.o and the others. Worried about I am running 
out of submissions. I've made the makefile 3 different ways that all worked but
none pass the test and I verified by compiling each executable seperately and 
with all. At this point I am just going to compile them all and submit.
