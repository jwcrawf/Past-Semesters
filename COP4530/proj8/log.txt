Log file for Kevin Bacon proj8

4/16/2018 8:44AM: Just copied over the files and reading the doc, what in the
world is this hahah?

3:24PM: At this point I have read everything a few times now and watched all the
videos. I created moviematch.h and made the class definition. Also made
skeletons for the functions and implemented the two that were given on the
assignment doc (dump and shuffle). Still unsure about all the files to include
but I guess I will have to add any I missed as I go.

5:51PM: Added Shuffle to graph.h and updated it's definition.

7:08PM: Decided to have another run at MovieMatch to try and find all behaviors
expected or otherwise. Getting tired will probably stop soon.

Welcome to MovieMatch ( Monroe, Marilyn )
Enter actor name ('0' to quit, '$' to shuffle): Pitt, Brad
 The KB Number of 'Pitt, Brad' is: 3
  Do you want proof? y
   A connecting path is:

 Pitt, Brad
   | Being John Malkovich (1999)
 Hairston, Jester
   | Alamo, The (1960)
 Graham, Fred (I)
   | Asphalt Jungle, The (1950)
 Monroe, Marilyn

4/16/2018 8:52AM: Working on a couple implementations this morning I decided to
work on the MovieDistance because it has a well formed hint in the assignment
doc. I have the general structure but now I am trying to determine if an actor
is a movie and I have come up with the fact that movies have digits from the
year and actors even if they're a second or third use roman numberals so I think
this is the only way to tell I am just about to try some ways to implement it. 

12:43PM: Really got a lot in here feeling good about getting started early, this
project is not looking easy at all I really feel for the people who are leaving
this last minute that is gonna be some pain. I went back to the wordsmith
projects to get my load idea under control and I feel like that is almost
wrapped up its a big function and there is a lot of stuff going on there so I am
happy to get it going. I can load right now its just very slow.

2:45PM: Yeah I totally forgot that I could rehash the buckets and speed all this
up so I am getting way better with Load and its looking great.

4:11PM: Still on this making all kinds of hay on these functions today, I'm in
the mood I guess because I totally figured out how to just use the second to
last character is a digit or not for movie and employ some of the idea from
cleanup.cpp, I am really liking how this project is like a tour de force of all
the stuff we learned this semester.

5:22PM: Okay looks like I messed that one up a bit:

Welcome to MovieMatch ( Bacon, Kevin )
Enter actor name ('0' to quit, '$' to shuffle): Monroe, Marilyn
 name 'Monroe, Marilyn' is a movie, not an actor

haha at least I'm doing things, albeit wrong things.
Actually I fixed that it works! and my method with the real quick check of just
the second to last character i think is really easy on resources so thats cool.

7:15PM: Trying to figure out hint, it seems to do 4 closest names regardless of
how hard I try to break it. 

Enter actor name ('0' to quit, '$' to shuffle): qop, rr
 Name 'qop, rr' not in DB 'movies.txt'
 Here are some similar name possibilities:
Qissi, Abdel
Qissi, Michel
Qrunnut, Stephen
Qu, Xuedong

8:19PM: Set up some pseudocode in hint because it was really lame that I had all
the functions and it was blank. Super tired now though I just have hint and
anything else it breaks along with it to do yet but I am calling it a day.

4/17/2018 3:21PM: Been working on this all day and really I am getting somewhere
now I am able to load everything up and get some Bacon Numbers, completely
clueless on hint still but I have eveything filled in except for that. 
Trying to get some load times and I have really chopped down my load function to
save time and now I am working on my sort in Init.

Selection sort:
crawford@linprog4.cs.fsu.edu:~/cop4530/proj8>kb.x movies_abbreviated.txt 'Bacon,
Kevin'

 Loading database movies_abbreviated.txt (first read) ...(second read) ... done.

Welcome to MovieMatch ( Bacon, Kevin )

Heap sort so much better it loads the whole movies.txt in what it takes the
selection sort to load the abbreviated version just about:
crawford@linprog5.cs.fsu.edu:~/cop4530/proj8>kb.x movies.txt 'Bacon, Kevin'

Enter actor name ('0' to quit, '$' to shuffle):

Closer to area51 also!

 Loading database movies.txt (first read) ...(second read) ... done.

 Load time: 1.43 sec
 Init time: 0.75 sec

Welcome to MovieMatch ( Bacon, Kevin )
Enter actor name ('0' to quit, '$' to shuffle): 

I beat you area51!
I went with only 10 buckets and a rehash to get this time, super cool.

4/18/2018: 8:43AM: Today is Hint day, all day hint day we'll see what I can do
here I know what I want to do is make a short string and check the first x or so
letters I haven't figured out the optimal length yet but that is the plan, then
check the upper and lower bound and print through that. seems easy enough, NOPE!

11:51AM: Tons of stuff is going on here and I can't imagine every student is
going to figure this out. 

4:31PM: Okay I am very deep into this function now and literally printing all
kinds of things and sizing them up to area51, really racking my brain with the
how to do this I thought I was getting closer and then I tried a different name
and I can't get it, the parameters are moving around on me here.

Hint issue, I figured out some stuff on hint:
I first tried adding one z and then using different bound numbers to set my
first substring for comparison but then I would always be either too much or
little, and then I started taking some off the top and bottom of the new hint
bounds and I still could not get it right, it appears to be a combination of
all plus another z and now I am looking for any special cases. 

Weird anomaly unknown symbol is at the bottom for lacher and at the beginning
for mine, otherwise I am finally able to match area51 hint output. 

Mine:
Enter actor name ('0' to quit, '$' to shuffle): d
 Name 'd' not in DB 'movies_abbreviated.txt'
 Here are some similar name possibilities:
D�az, Marlene
D�az, Yulian
D'Amario, Tony
D'Ambrose, Camille

Lacher:
Dymally, Amentha
Dysart, Richard A.
Dzundza, George
D�az Aroca, Miriam
D�az, Jennifer
Enter actor name ('0' to quit, '$' to shuffle):


Found an edge case to check on:
Enter actor name ('0' to quit, '$' to shuffle): aaa
 Name 'aaa' not in DB 'movies_abbreviated.txt'
 Here are some similar name possibilities:
ATL (2006)
AVP: Alien vs. Predator (2004)
Aalda, Mariann
Aames, Angela

Obviously this means my jerry-rigged -2 to lower and + 2 to upper wont work in
every scenario. Back to work on that. 
Fixed that pretty easy, don't increment at the bottom or top. OBVIOUSLY.

The Kevin Bacon number using movie_abbreviated is not the actual number because
it has way less info so there are less vertices and less edges to find paths.

7:18PM: This was really aggravating me with the difference and I was unable to 
figure out the anomaly with the symbols and its because I was using LessThan
predicate from the library and I needed to make my own for less than and greater
than at the same time. I actually had to go back to cstringsort proj1 from 3330
to figure out what I wanted to do and then I also found it on the C++ reference
library from the course page listed below to make sure it was doable. 
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/list/list/sort/

Now I am able to get the same output as area51, I wasted a good amount of time
thinking for sure my logic was off in the way I implemented hint and this really
was difficult to figure out with so little to go on. But it was a combination of
things related to how I sorted with the predicate, once I had the sort correctly
I was able to quickly adjust my hint implementation to make use of the change.

First submittal have a small printing error in showstar and also getting a think
where it says my loading line is wrong but it looks identical, also the times
will be different obviously so I can see how that line shows a diff.

Had a go at fixing the spacing here. Plan to tackle some other diffs tomorrow.

4/19/2018: 3:21PM Have been working on the diffs from my first submittal today.
The main problem for me is that my little check for if the second to last
character is a digit does not work on the robograder for things like Movie D.
I decided to make a list of movies and then check for includes on the list. My
version of checking the digit is no doubt faster but this meets the robocheck so
its a compromise in my opinion.
 
Also I noticed that the showstar is sorted so I had to do a quick sort on that to
get it to print alphabetically, I used selection sort on that just cause its not
that much data. After making a small list of the output about to be shown.

Experimenting with my movie list add on and trying to see performance difference
I cannot find much difference between containers.

Welcome to MovieMatch ( Bacon, Kevin )
Enter actor name ('0' to quit, '$' to shuffle):


I decided to go with the this look at that! 1.38 and down on the movie check
from init. Sticking with this setup.


4/21/2018 9:55AM: Last night and this morning I have been experimenting with the
Levenshtein distance formula which is the edit difference between
strings. Trying to make an intuitive hint for typo suggestion and it's really
fun to mess around with. Hard to nail it down but I have gotten close.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance

Enter actor name ('0' to quit, '$' to shuffle): Monroe, Mary
 Name 'Monroe, Mary' not in DB 'movies.txt'
 Here are some similar name possibilities:
Monero, Mark
Monjou, Marc
Monroe, Marilyn
Morrow, Mari
Morse, Mark
Morter, Mary
Enter actor name ('0' to quit, '$' to shuffle):

These names are with an edit distance of 3 apart! I can't use it for the robo
check though because it will show all the names since they are like zzz and xxx
so they are all too similar but with the complexity of the real names it is
something neat to work on. For example if I reduce the threshold to two and use
the robo values I can get something like this:

Enter actor name ('0' to quit, '$' to shuffle): aab
 Name 'aab' not in DB 'movie_test.1'
 Here are some similar name possibilities:
aaa
aaaa
bbb
Enter actor name ('0' to quit, '$' to shuffle): axab
 Name 'axab' not in DB 'movie_test.1'
 Here are some similar name possibilities:
aaa
aaaa
Enter actor name ('0' to quit, '$' to shuffle): 

On the full list with edit distance 2 it looks like this:

Enter actor name ('0' to quit, '$' to shuffle): Pitt, Br
 Name 'Pitt, Br' not in DB 'movies.txt'
 Here are some similar name possibilities:
Pitt, Brad
Enter actor name ('0' to quit, '$' to shuffle):

If I put the distance back up to 3 and include lowercase typos I can get an
output like this:

Enter actor name ('0' to quit, '$' to shuffle): Pitt, bra
 Name 'Pitt, bra' not in DB 'movies.txt'
 Here are some similar name possibilities:
Pitt, Brad
Pitt, Mark
Pitt, Mary
Pitt, Myla
Pitts, Mia
Witt, Brian
Enter actor name ('0' to quit, '$' to shuffle):

I think this is pretty cool because it possible the person made a typo in the
first character so the lower upper bound hint wouldn't help them in that case!

This person below typing Ben Walton might have meant Ben Welden or Ben Elton 
their memory was probably fuzzy!

Enter actor name ('0' to quit, '$' to shuffle): Walton, Ben
 Name 'Walton, Ben' not in DB 'movies.txt'
 Here are some similar name possibilities:
Bilson, Ben
Dalton, Lee
Elton, Ben
Keaton, Ben
Nealon, Ben
Peyton, Ben
Welden, Ben
Enter actor name ('0' to quit, '$' to shuffle):

Alright I have a research paper due Sunday midnight so I am going to get back to
work on that but i will probably come back to this in the summer and try to
perfect it just as an exercise.
