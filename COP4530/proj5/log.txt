Log file for proj5 BST iterators

3/5/2018 8:40AM: Read the assignment doc last night and this morning and just
copied over the files to get a look at the project. Plan to do a full recon this
morning and get started on wordsmith3 today. From the looks of the files I can
see there is a significant amount of implementation work to be done so I am glad
I decided to start early on this one.

3/6/2018 10:40AM: Had some trouble with my new version of Height returning
one different than the area51 fmap. I was able to solve this by checking for if
the base tree node has any children before doing the recursion. If you think
about this is like the base case in a proof with induction so theres symmetry.

3/6/2018 2:03PM: Stole my == implementation from list.h. It is using a for loop
and sequential but I can't see another logical way to implement. Gonna see how
that shakes out later for now.

3/9/2018  3:31PM: Can't figure out how I can put, get and insert but my includes
function is still searching for certain values while others it can return key
not found. Trying to understand what makes these keys special that are not able
to break out.
 
command ('M' for menu, 'Q' to quit): f t5.in
  ** table data read and stored
command ('M' for menu, 'Q' to quit): i ted
 iterator at entry <ted,3>
command ('M' for menu, 'Q' to quit): i ten
^C

3/10/2018 9:07AM: So I think I have figured out a clue as to why the Includes
keeps searching for some values its because they were similar values and it was
unable to further seperate their equality. See the implementation below. This
also holding me back from even trying mmap_bst because it just blanks out so
this is gonna have to get figured out its a roadblock for now.

command ('M' for menu, 'Q' to quit): f t5.in
  ** table data read and stored
command ('M' for menu, 'Q' to quit): i ted
 iterator at entry <ted,3>
command ('M' for menu, 'Q' to quit): i ten
 iterator at entry <ted,3>
command ('M' for menu, 'Q' to quit): i tex
 iterator at entry <ted,3>
command ('M' for menu, 'Q' to quit): q

3/16/2018 1:31PM: Totally got it I had to adopt some of the logic from the upper
bound function but it finally breaks out. and It is still using the algorithm so
it will meet the engineering specs for time complexity.


command ('M' for menu, 'Q' to quit): f t5.in
  ** table data read and stored
command ('M' for menu, 'Q' to quit): i ted
 iterator at entry <ted,3>
command ('M' for menu, 'Q' to quit): i ten
 key not found
command ('M' for menu, 'Q' to quit): i tex
 key not found
command ('M' for menu, 'Q' to quit): i ted
 iterator at entry <ted,3>
command ('M' for menu, 'Q' to quit): i joi
 iterator at entry <joi,3>
command ('M' for menu, 'Q' to quit): i job
 key not found
command ('M' for menu, 'Q' to quit): q

Also was able to test mmap finally with something happening at is working.

 Depth distrubution shown with compression divisor 7
   x2.Size()              ==  3959
   x2.Height()            ==  26
   optimal ht (size)      ==  11

Test Complete

Might try a first submit to see where I'm erroring.
